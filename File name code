File name code

This document can also be found at http://marsrover.nasa.gov/gallery/edr_filename_key.html

Below is a chart that will help you decode the 27 character file 
names associated with the Mars Exploration Rover mission. 
There is enough info below to allow you to make 
stereograms and construct color pictures and determine 
when and where the raw images were taken. Enjoy!

3 to 11   Spacecraft clock
        This is the number of seconds since January 1, 2000 
        at 11:58:55.816 UTC.

12 to 14 Product type
        Product types are differentiated as having camera-induced 
        distortion removed (geometrically "linearized") or not 
        removed (nominal), and, as being thumbnail-sized or not. 
        Four special flag characters follow:

        a) Beginning E - Type of EDR, which are raw with no camera 
           model  linearization or radiometric correction. If no 
           beginning E, then it is a Reduced Data Record (RDR).
        b) Ending T - EDR or RDR that is Thumbnail -sized.
        c) Ending L - If no beginning E , denotes an RDR that is 
           Linearized, except for Thumbnail sized RDRs.
        d) Ending N - If no beginning E , denotes an RDR that is 
           ThumbNail-sized and Linearized .

Example:

A photo with the file name 
2P126471340EDN0000P2303L5M1.JPG would be from 
Spirit (2), taken by the left PANCAM through the 
535nm (green) filter. By matching the spacecraft times 
(in this case 126471340) with other pictures that have a 
similar time, you can find sets that were taken at the same time 
of the day. Use similar sets to build stereograms and color 
composites. This picture was downsampled (EDN) at 
site 0 (00) and position 0 (00) (On the lander in this case!) 
It was taken with command sequence P2303 for MIPL 
(OPGS) at JPL and is version 1.
